Answers to the questions:

1.What changes would you make to make this work for any dataset, not just Titanic

First, target column would not be fixed as in this case to survived. The user should specify the target column in the instruction
and also provide the path to the dataset. Based on the target column, the program should then decide whether the problem is a
classification or a regression. Also, the code should be updated so it can work with regression models.

2. What would be different if this was a solution where instructions are received in a chat (for example “Drop
the Age feature” followed by “Now train the model”) instead of a single instruction

In that case, the system would need to remember the previous instructions and update the object (in this case Plan),
after each instruction. This could be implemented using a loop, where in each iteration the LLM agent updates the Plan
based on the user’s instructions. The loop would continue until the user sends a specific command like exit to end the interaction.

3. How would you enable EDA features such as “What is the mean age of all females on board under 25”

To enable EDA features, the system should  detect whether the user is asking for data analysis or for training a model. In the
case of a data analysis request, the LLM agent would return a structured JSON output indicating that data analysis is required,
along with information about which columns to analyze and which filters to apply. This JSON output would then be passed to a
separate data analysis function that would execute the filters on the dataset and return the result.

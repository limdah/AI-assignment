Assumptions:

- This system works with the Titanic dataset, and the task is always binary classification for survival prediction.
- The user provides a single instruction per run.
- The system supports feature selection instructions such as dropping columns, keeping only specific columns, or dropping all columns except specified ones.
- The system supports model selection between logistic regression and random forest.
- If no model is mentioned in the instruction, logistic regression is used as default model.
- The default planner is an LLM-based agent that converts the user instruction into a structured JSON plan.
- The LLM-based agent is implemented using OpenRouter and  requires the user to provide a valid OpenRouter API
  key via the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable (more detailes in README.md).
- If the user provides an invalid instruction, the LLM agent falls back to default settings (logistic regression
  with all available feature columns except the target column are used).
- Model hyperparameters are kept simple and mostly use default or fixed values.
- No hyperparameter tuning is performed.
- Missing values in numeric columns are filled using the median.
- Missing values in categorical columns are filled using the most frequent value.
- Categorical columns are converted using one-hot encoding.
- A 80/20 train/test split is used.
- The evaluation outputs include a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- If required inputs are missing, such as a missing CSV file, an empty instruction, or a missing target column, the program exits with an error.
